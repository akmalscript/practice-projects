# Practice Projects

This repository contains a collection of small-scale projects I created as part of my personal learning journey. Each project focuses on different programming concepts, tools, or technologies that Iâ€™ve been exploring.

## ðŸ’¡ Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to:

- Practice and reinforce programming fundamentals.
- Experiment with new ideas, tools, and technologies.
- Build a personal reference archive for future projects.
- Track progress over time.

## ðŸ“Œ Note

These projects are for **educational purposes** and may not follow production-level standards. Feel free to explore, fork, or use them as a starting point for your own learning.

Thank you for visiting this repository!
